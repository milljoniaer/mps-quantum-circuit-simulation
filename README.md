# MPS Quantum Computing Simulation
This Repository contains quantum circuit simutlation using a Matrix-Product-State representation of the quantum state. It is an approximation algorithm to scale linear with the number of qubits and the depth of the circuit. It has been written for the Quantum Computing Seminar at the Technical University of Munich. The simulator is based on a paper about the ["Limits of the simulation of quantum computers on classical computers"](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.10.041038).

## Installation
To install the dependencys of this project run `pip3 install numpy`. This project relies on the algebraic operations of numpy.

## Examples

### Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state
Run `python3 ghz-simulation.py` to generate the [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state) with 3 particles, using the MPS simulation. The ouput should be a statevector in the GHZ format.

### Complicated Circuit
This a circuit to test how efficient this simulation is. Adjust N (number of qubits) and D (number of 2 particle gates on each qubit), to see the performance of the simulation. This circuit is the one they use in the paper for their research. It is used in the paper to proof that classical computers can still rival quantum computers like googles [sydacore processore](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/10/quantum-supremacy-using-programmable.html).

The time for applying the circuit is measured and printed. Run `python3 complicated-circuit.py` to do so.

1-qubit gate: h-gate; 2-qubit gate: control-not gate
