# mps-quantum-circuit-simulation
This Repository contains a MPS based quantum circuit simutlation. It has been written for the Quantum Computing Seminar at the Technical University of Munich. The simulator is based on a paper about the ["Limits of the simulation of quantum computers on classical computers"](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.10.041038).
